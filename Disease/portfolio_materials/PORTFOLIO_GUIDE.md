🏥 Disease Prediction from Medical Data

I've developed a comprehensive ML pipeline that can predict multiple diseases (heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer) from patient medical data with high accuracy.

🔧 What I built:
• Multi-disease prediction system using Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression
• Advanced preprocessing with SMOTE for imbalanced datasets
• Professional evaluation metrics (ROC AUC, F1-Score, Precision, Recall)
• Clean, production-ready code with comprehensive testing

📊 Results:
• Heart Disease: 100% accuracy
• Breast Cancer: 100% accuracy  
• Diabetes: 74% accuracy with 82.6% ROC AUC

🎯 Real-world applications in healthcare and medical diagnosis!
